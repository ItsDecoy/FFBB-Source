		This is the main class of the project, it basically connects everything together.
		If you know what you're doing, go ahead and shoot! if you're looking for something more specific, however,
		try accessing some game objects or meta files, meta files control the information (say what's playing on screen)
		and game objects are like the boyfriend, girlfriend and the oppontent. 

		Thanks for using my little modular engine project! I really appreciate it. 
		If you've got any suggestions let me know at Shubs#0404 on discord or create a ticket on the github.

		To run through the basics, I've essentially created a rewrite of Friday Night Funkin that is supposed to be
		more modular for mod devs to use if they want to, as well as to give mod devs a couple legs up in terms of
		things like organisation and such, since I haven't really seen any engines that are organised like this.
		also, playstate was getting real crowded so I did a me and decided to rewrite everything instead of just
		fixing the problems with FNF :P

		yeah this is a problem I have
		it has to be perfect or else it isn't presentable

		I'm sure I'll write this down in the github, but this is an open source Friday Night Funkin' Modding engine
		which is completely open for anyone to modify. I have a couple of requests and prerequisites however, and that is
		that you, number one, in no way claim this engine as your own. If you're going to make an open source modification to the engine
		you should run a pull request or fork and not create a new standalone repo for it. If you're actually going to mod the game however,
		please, by all means, create your own repository for it instead as it would be your project then. I also request the engine is credited
		somewhere in the project. (in the gamebanana page, wherever you'd like/is most convenient for you!)
		if you don't wanna credit me that's fine, I just ask for the project to be in the credits somewhere 
		I do ask that you credit me if you make an actual modification to the engine or something like that, basically what I said above

		I have no idea how licenses work so pretend I'm professional or something AAAA
		thank you for using this engine it means a lot to me :)

		if you have any questions like I said, shoot me a message or something, I'm totally cool with it even if it's just help with programming or something
